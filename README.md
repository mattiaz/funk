# Funk Programming Language

## Introduction
Funk is a custom programming language with its own interpreter. It was developed as part of the TDP019 course at Linköping University. Funk aims to provide a clean, expressive syntax with functional programming capabilities.

## Features
 -  Custom syntax designed for clarity and expressiveness
 -  Functional programming paradigm
 -  Static typing system
 -  Built-in error handling
 -  Comprehensive logging system

## Installation

### Prerequisites
 - C++ compiler with `c++17` support or higher
 - Make build system
 - Standard C++ libraries
 - `gtest` library for testing

### Building from Source
1. Clone the repository:

```zsh
git clone https://gitlab.liu.se/mataj513/tdp019.git
cd tdp019
```

2. Build the interpreter:
```zsh
make
```

3. For a clean build:
```zsh
make clean
make
```

## Usage
After building the Funk interpreter, you can use it in the following ways:

### Running Funk Programs
To execute a Funk program file:
```zsh
./bin/funk <path_to_file>
```

See examples in the [examples](examples) directory.

For more help and options see:
```zsh
./bin/funk --help
```

### Logging
The interpreter uses a logging system to provide detailed information about its execution.
The log file is located at `funk.log` but can be changed by adding `--log new/path.log` to the program.

## Testing
Funk comes with a comprehensive test suite to ensure functionality:

1. Run all tests (compiles and executes tests):
```zsh
./compile+test
```

2. Compile tests only:
```zsh
make tests
```

3. Run a specific test:
```zsh
./bin/tests/<name>
```

## Documentation

### Language Specification
See the [Language Specification](docs/Language%20Specification.pdf) for a formal description of the Funk language.

### Doxygen Documentation
To generate the detailed documentation, run the following command:
```zsh
doxygen Doxyfile
```

The generated documentation will be available in the `docs/html` directory. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser
to view the documentation.
